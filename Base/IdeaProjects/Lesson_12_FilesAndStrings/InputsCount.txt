The BufferedImage subclass describes an Image with an accessible buffer of image data. A BufferedImage is comprised of a ColorModel and a Raster of image data.
The number and types of bands in the SampleModel of the Raster must match the number and types required by the ColorModel to represent its color and alpha components.
All BufferedImage objects have an upper left corner coordinate of (0, 0). Any Raster used to construct a BufferedImage must therefore have minX=0 and minY=0.
